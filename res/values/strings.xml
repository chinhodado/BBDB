        <b>Q: What are the different stats type (Base, Max, PE, POPE)?</b> <br/>
        A: <br/> 
        Base is the stats of a familiar at capture or from a pact (at LV1). 
            It is the lowest stats that you can see of a familiar.  <br/><br/>
        Max is the stats of a familiar fully leveled up (i.e. LV 70 for a Rare, 
            or LV 99 for an Epic), without evolution or adding crystals. <br/><br/>
        PE (Perfect Evolution) is the highest stats of a familiar that can be achieved by 
            leveling up and evolving, AND without adding crystals. For example, to make a 
            PE Epic 4 familiar you need 8 Rare 1 familiars.<br/><br/>
        POPE (Perfect Over Perfect Evolution) is similar to PE, but with the maximum number of crystals added. 
            This is generally 400 crystals for 8-card evolutions and 100 for 2-card evolutions. <br/><br/>
            
        <b>Q: What are the different tiers for PvP, Raid and Tower?</b> <br/>
        A: <br/> 
        Tier X: These familiars are the most powerful in the game. They are extremely difficult to obtain, 
            and are almost always found amongst the highest ranking players. They excel in the roles they play, 
            having exceptional skills and high stats. While these familiars are universally Legendaries or Mythics, 
            not all Legendaries qualify for this tier.  <br/><br/>
        Tier S+: Familiars in this tier rank are nearly the strongest in the game, second only to the "broken" familiars. 
            They are very difficult to obtain, and are commonly found among brigades achieving top ranks in events. 
            While these familiars are almost all universally Legendaries, note that not all Legendary familiars qualify for this tier. <br/><br/>
        Tier S: Familiars in this tier are extremely powerful. They are difficult to obtain, and are still often found 
            among brigades achieving top ranks in events. They often have either poorer base stats or poorer skills than familiars in Tier S+. 
            While these familiars are almost all universally Legendaries, note that not all Legendary familiars qualify for this tier. <br/><br/>
        Tier A+: Familiars in this tier are the strongest possible below Legendary status. They can be found amongst brigades 
            that achieve high ranks in events. They usually provide either very high damage or very high utility to their team, 
            and their skills are usually less situational than the lower tiers\'. A team consisting entirely of familiars from this tier 
            has a decent chance of defeating Tier S/S+ teams. <br/><br/>
        Tier A: Familiars in this tier are considered to be very strong. They can be found amongst some brigades achieving high ranks 
            in events. They tend to be somewhat outclassed by Tier A+ familiars, either by their stats or skill-wise, but are still good 
            choices for a strong brigade. A team consisting entirely of familiars from this tier can occasionally defeat Tier S/S+ teams. <br/><br/>
        Tier B: Familiars in this tier are considered to be the lower end of high-level competitiveness. They are often the poorest familiars 
            in brigades achieving high ranks in events. They tend to be completely outclassed by Tier A+ familiars, but are still far 
            stronger than familiars in the lower tiers. A team consisting entirely of familiars from this tier will very rarely defeat 
            Tier S/S+ teams. <br/><br/>
        Tier C: Familiars in this tier are considered to be fair to average. They are good choices for anyone on the path to building a higher-tier team. 
            The skills they possess are usually either highly situational, or inferior in damage and/or utility to those held by higher tier familiars. 
            Good performance in events with a team entirely comprised of these familiars is difficult, but not impossible. <br/><br/>
