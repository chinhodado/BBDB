        <b>Q: What are the different stats type (Base, Max, PE, POPE)?</b> <br/>
        A: <br/> 
        Base is the stats of a familiar at capture or from a pact.   <br/><br/>
        Max is the stats of a familiar fully leveled up, without evolution or adding crystals. <br/><br/>
        PE (Perfect Evolution) is the highest stats of a familiar that can be achieved by 
            leveling up and evolving, and without adding crystals. <br/><br/>
        POPE (Perfect Over Perfect Evolution) is similar to PE, but with the maximum number of crystals added. 
            This is generally 400 crystals for 8-card evolutions and 100 for 2-card evolutions.<br/><br/>
